CSS
basic : all content of the div come in next line so when ever we want to next line use div.
when we are creating a list and the dots will come so when we wan tto remove the dots we can use    list-style-type: none; it will remove the dots from left side.

    color: rgb(201, 32, 64);
})

2. Font weight is minimun 100 and maximum is 900

rem : font size of html, what we set for the root element it will act like that.

if i want to give distance from doccumnet from the top or fron documnet fron the right or from the document from the bottom, we can do right left and all.


relative: we can change any top, bottom,left,right

absolute: position which is non static, parent parents elements(ancestors). from the closer position. for right side we can use this also

fixed: it will chnage to all positions from the right side. used in navigation bar

Flexbox: it is a one-dimensional layout. it is flexible. (4hrs__________)
flex container when we write display property as the flex it will become the flex conatiner. these will try make them selves to fit in any container or to become small or large.till font size will allow, if font size is bigger then it will come outside. 
1.flex direction: sets how items are placed in the flex container along with axis and direction.
flex-direction:row(it is default) from left to right
flex-direction: row-reverse (right to left)
flex-direction: coloumn; vertically arranged top to bottom
flex-direction:column-reverse( bottom to top).

justify-content:flex-start; (main access of start from left to right)
justify-content:flex-end ;(main access of start from right to left)
justify-content:centre ;(main access of start from  the centre)
justify-content:space-around; (if there is a apce then we can add this one and they will split 4.06 hrs the space were from corner space it will double in the between)
justify-content:space-between (the all the space will come in the between corner will no spce)
justify-content:space-evenly (space will spread same amount space in all)

level4
felx-wrap: nowrap; it will not wrap 
flex-wrap:wrap; top to bottom
felx-wrap:wrap-reverse; it will come bottom to top

align-items: centre; it will come in the  centre from axis. apply in container
align-content: space between & around the content along cross axis.

flex-shrink: 2; it will shrink upto to 2 times in which we will aplly.
flex-grow:2; it will increase its size to 2 times, until all are adjust.

when they are in coloumn then we can set them as single line display: inline it will come in same line.

for the left to right we will use justify-content:centre.

Media Queries:
Help to create a reponsive website. website should be responsive 
@media in that we can set in width 500px to set color change in when it will reach to 500px.
we can set the font size small and big when it is needed in this.
@media(min-width:200px)and(max-width:400px){
div{
background-color:green;
}
}


level 5
effects, move, animations.
Transitions 
pseudo class : define a different state
Transistion-property: property that we wan to transitions, we can change the color or property when the cursor will be on that
transition-duration:4s; (4 seconds it will come and go) t is a time limit.
transistion-timing-function: see in mdn once all properties well explained
transition-delay: 1s. it will delay after the 1 second after 1s it will apply the transistion property.

Transistion shorthand
property name| duration|timing-function|delay
transition:font-size 2s ease-in-out 0.2s


CSS transform:
transform:rotate(45deg); it will apply in the content also.
we can rotate in with axis to x y z

Scale
transform:scale(2); it will increase the size in 2 times
transform:scale(1,2); it will increase in y axis but not in x axis
transform:scale(2,1); it will increase in x axis but not in y axis
we can do hover in this 
div:hover{
transform:scaleY(2)
} when we will go to that our  cursor then that y axis size will incsrease

Translate:
transform:translate(20px); it will tanslate in x and y axis
transfrom:translate(20px, 50px);
transform:translateX(500px);  move right or left side or -500px
transform:translateY(500px); move up and down or -500 px

Skew: 
transform:skew(90deg); check it in output

Animation:
@keyframe myNmae(we have suggest one name){
form{background-color:___}
to {background-color:___}
}
it will tell the template
animation-name: myName;
animation-duration:
animation-timing-function:
animation-delay:
animation-iteration-count: (it will tell how many mine animation will come 1,2 or infinte)
animation-direction: normal
animation-direction:reverse
animation-direction:alternate
animation-direction:alternate-re

animation: myName 2s linear 3s infinite normal
name, duration, timing function, iteration count, direction

Animation percentage %
@keyframe myNmae(we have suggest one name){
0%{font-size:20px;}
50%{font-size:30;}
100%{font-size:40px;}
}

loader - it is a loading when the network is low.
.loader{
width:200px;
height:200px;
border-radius:50%;
border-top:20px solid black;
animation: spinanimate 3s ease-in 0s infinte normal;
}

@keyframes spinanimate{
from{
transform:rotate(0deg):
}
to{
transform:rotate(360deg):
}
}
